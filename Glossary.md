## Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

An abstract syntax tree is a tree-like data structure that represents the syntactic structure of source code...

## Arguments

Arguments are values that are passed to a function or method when it is called...

## Bytecode

Bytecode is a lower-level representation of Python code that is generated by the Python interpreter...

## Decorator

A decorator is a special kind of function that can modify the behavior of another function...

## Descriptor

A descriptor is a Python object that defines one or more methods (__get__, __set__, or __delete__)...

## Generator

A generator is a special kind of iterator that generates values on-the-fly...

## Namespace

A namespace is a mapping from names to objects...

## Package
