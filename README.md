# Hello World

The simplest Python program consists of a single line that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

#Variables and Data Types

Python has several built-in data types. The most common ones are:

    `int`: Integer numbers
    `float`: Floating-point numbers
    `str`: String (text)
    `bool`: Boolean (True or False)

You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator `=`.


```python
integer_var = 42
float_var = 3.14
string_var = "Python"
boolean_var = True
```

#Operators

Python provides various operators for performing operations on variables and values. Some common operators are:

    Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, //, %, **
    Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
    Logical operators: and, or, not

#Control Structures

Python uses control structures to control the flow of code execution. The most common control structures are:
#If, elif, and else
